        <p>
                In the current academic world of mathematics or engineering, most scholarly jour-
                nals expect scientific articles to be typed out in a professional manner. Any well
                reputed journal, including Linear Algebra and Its Applications, Electronic Journal
                of Linear Algebra, International Journal of Engineering Science and Journal of Ap-
                plied Mechanics accepts articles in the form tex files which are known for their
                professional type settings and remain flexible throughout all operating systems. As
                a result, editing or modifying the content become easier and converting from one
                template to another is also less cumbersome.
        </p>
        <p>
                It is a known fact that researchers struggle to align and format mathematical
                equations in WYSIWYG editors such as Microsoft Word. This is also true for
                figures and tables especially with regard to captioning them and referring them
                elsewhere in the document. One editor that aims to address these issues is $\LaTeX$ .
                $\LaTeX$ has an excellent in-built referencing system to label and refer tables and figures
                anywhere in the document. Bibliographies and indices are also crucial to academic
                writing. $\LaTeX$ makes it easy to type equations, to keep the figures and tables at ap-
                propriate places and handles the bibliography with ease. $\LaTeX$ s ability to handle
                the subject indices as well as author indices are also remarkable.
        </p>
        <p>
                The most admirable feature of the $\LaTeX$ is the clear separation between the con-
                tent and the formatting of the document. The in-built coding takes care of many
                things which allows content to be typed without formatting adjustments. As a
                result,the typographical quality of the document is always much improved when
                compared to any WYSIWYG editor. Version control (Git,GNU,CVS,etc) is a very
                powerful tool that is widely used and allows easy reversal earlier versions of the doc-
                ument without storing multiple copies. $\LaTeX$ also enables real-time collaboration on
                a single document by two different parties simultaneously Furthermore, $\LaTeX$ needs
                only text files to create documents, which makes is it easy to write a small script
                and to generate large documents such as results of a program, weather reports, time
                tables, catalogues and the like. A predefined template can easily be converted into
                a script by the computer directly..
        </p>

        <p>
                The learning curve in $\LaTeX$ is straightforward and unique and as a result, unor-
                ganised documents cannot be created in $\LaTeX$ . Linked below is one article explain-
                ing in further detail, the ease in using $\LaTeX$  over WYSIWYG editors -
